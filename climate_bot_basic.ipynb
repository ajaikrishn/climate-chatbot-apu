Shift in species abundance and diversity, increase in weather and climate extremes such as heat waves, droughts, precipitation and cyclones are repercussions of such anthropogenic impact on climate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report , India is one of the global hotspots for climate change. The country has a high population density and a signiﬁcant portion of the population that relies on agriculture and natural resources for their survival. It is consequently highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Changes in the monsoonal rainfall pattern will have a signiﬁcant impact on the country's agrarian economy and food security. In addition, India is also already experiencing an increase in extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, ﬂoods, droughts, and cyclones, in addition to the rise in temperature. From 1986-2015, the annual mean, maximum and minimum temperatures over India have shown substantial warming trends during the pre-monsoon season (March-April-May). The frequency of heat extremes in India has increased between 1950-2015, and warming has occurred over the past three decades with an accelerated rate. Droughts and ﬂoods are also projected to increase, as per the climate model data, which will have a further negative impact on the economy, health, and food supply of the people. There is also a noticeable increase in the frequency of post-monsoon cyclonic storms, causing severe consequences on the coastal communities. Given these alarming projections, immediate and effective actions are essential to adapt to the anticipated changes. To take action, the ﬁrst priority is to obtain detailed, ﬁne-scale knowledge of the expected impacts of climate change. This report is designed to provide that critical information. 4 ` IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to investigate the potential future impacts of climate change and possible responses to it. These scenarios describe different possible future worlds. Each one is based on a different set of assumptions about how people, the economy, and technology will change in the future. The SSPs make it easy to compare how different socioeconomic paths affect greenhouse gas emissions and the changes in the Earth's climate that come from them. They also give a way to judge how well different strategies for preventing and dealing with climate change are working. The SSPs are based on ﬁve different socioeconomic pathways: ● SSP1: \"Sustainability\": This pathway assumes that society will take strong and coordinated action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, leading to a more sustainable future. ● SSP2: \"Middle of the Road\": This path assumes that society will take moderate steps to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change,\n",
